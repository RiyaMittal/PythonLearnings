The rural community of Chapais was established as a mining town in 1955. At its peak, the mine employed 700 of the
3500 inhabitants of the town, with a sawmill employing another 450.[2]:1 Falconbridge Copper Ltd., who operated
the Opemiska mine, gifted the town with a community hall that could host 300 people. On December 8, 1979, the
ine hosted a Christmas party for its employees at the community hall. A large number of Christmas trees
 were installed as decoration, and for the second year in a row, a large arch made
 of pine branches was installed near the entrance. Following
 the party, it was decided that the
 decorations would be kept in the
 room for the upcoming New Year celebration.
 In order to prevent the branches from drying
 out, an employee of the town hall was tasked
 with spraying the decorations with water. The
 employee went home during the holidays, resulting
 in the branches drying out for a few days
 between Christmas and the New Year.[2]:2

During the night of 31 December 1979, the
 community hall hosted the New Year
 event as a fundraiser for the local
 Lions Club. The entrance fee
 was five dollars, and the club
 sold around 300 tickets. It was
 tradition in Chapais for people
 to move between different social
 gatherings in the new year to
 wish members of the community
 success in the new year. As
 such, it was decided that
 past midnight, people could
 enter without a ticket.[2]:2
